Problem Statement 
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to 
their insufficient or non-existent credit history 
Observing the application: 
• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan 
results in a loss of business to the company 
• If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, 
then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
